# Landing Page Project

There are 4 pages in the pages:
    - Navigation links are created and added dynamically.
    - When one of the navigation links is clicked, it gets highlighted which makes it different from others.
    - When a link is clicked, appropriate section is scrolled smoothly.
    - When scrolling gets to the required section, the section is highlighted which makes it differentiate from others.
    - When scrolling reaches the end of page, there is a button which scrolls back to top of the page.
    - Some changes & designs are made to the page.
